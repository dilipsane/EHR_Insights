Our approach to this project is to create a comprehensive dashboard that provided an overview of patient care and outcomes in the eICU Collaborative Database using Tableau. To do this, we started by identifying the key metrics and data points that we wanted to include in the dashboards. These metrics included patient demographics, length of stay, diagnoses, resources utilization, and lab outcome.
Next, we collected the necessary tables from the eICU Collaborative Database and imported them into Tableau for analysis and visualization. We also cleaned and processed the data to ensure that it was accurate and consistent.
